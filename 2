- Alerts are triggered and throttling is initiated during event storms.
9. Monitoring and Incident Reporting for New Pods	As an SRE, I want to monitor and report incidents for new pods after deployment to ensure logs and metrics for new services are available immediately.	- Monitoring is set up to detect new pods after deployment.
- Logs and metrics from new pods are available in Grafana Loki and Prometheus without delay.
- Incidents are reported if logs/metrics are missing.
- A summary report is generated post-deployment to monitor pod performance and behavior.
10. Consistency Across Dev and Prod Environments	As an Observability Engineer, I want to ensure logging, metrics, and trace configurations are consistent across development and production environments to avoid production issues.	- Fluent Bit DaemonSet and OpenTelemetry Collector configurations are consistent across both dev and prod.
- Pod startup logs are monitored in both environments.
- Scaling events in production match behavior in development.
- Discrepancies between environments are flagged and resolved before production deployment.
User Stories from Application User and Business Use Case Perspective
User Story	Description	Acceptance Criteria
1. Application Developer Needs Log Insights	As an Application Developer, I want detailed access to the logs of my services to understand errors and optimize performance without configuring a logging agent per service.	- Logs are automatically collected by Fluent Bit DaemonSet without requiring manual configuration.
- Logs are viewable in Grafana Loki with service names and timestamps.

- Logs are retained and accessible based on predefined retention policies (e.g., 30 days).
2. Real-Time Monitoring of Key Metrics	As a Business Analyst, I want to monitor the performance of my application in real time by accessing key business metrics such as cart abandonment rates and response times.	- Prometheus collects key business metrics such as response time, user interactions, and cart abandonment.
- Grafana dashboard displays these metrics in real time.
- Alerts are triggered if any metric exceeds the defined threshold (e.g., cart abandonment rate > 5%).
- Business teams can access and create custom dashboards for specific KPIs.
3. Incident Response During High-Traffic Events	As a Support Engineer, I need quick access to logs and traces during high-traffic events to troubleshoot performance issues in real time and reduce downtime for users.	- Logs from high-traffic events are viewable in Grafana Loki.
- Traces are accessible in Jaeger with detailed timing information to identify bottlenecks.
