### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Parallelizable Tasks**:
   - Tasks like **D1 (CRD design)**, **D2 (Operator implementation)**, **D3 (CI/CD integration)**, and **D4 (Monitoring integration)** can run in parallel to accelerate development.

2. **Critical Dependencies**:
   - **D5 (Unit testing)** must be completed before any deployment phase can begin.
   - **DEP3 (Production deployment)** depends on thorough validation in testing and development environments.

3. **Good-to-Have Tasks**:
   - Tasks like **Rollback validation**, **Training**, and **Documentation** can be deferred or run in parallel post-deployment.
