To address Srikanta's question and push for providing the Prometheus-nginxlog-exporter image, here's a potential response:

Hi Srikanta,

The **Prometheus-nginxlog-exporter** is specifically designed as a sidecar container to parse and export NGINX access logs in a Prometheus-compatible format. It simplifies the process and ensures efficient log-to-metrics conversion. While other images/utilities could serve a similar purpose, this image is purpose-built for this task, making it the most straightforward and reliable solution.

Could you please help expedite the process of providing the Prometheus-nginxlog-exporter image? It will save us time and effort compared to testing or building alternative utilities.

Let me know if any further confirmation is required.

Thanks!
