Regarding STEP-167 ([link](https://bts.coupang.net/browse/STEP-167)), it was noted that the ticket was rejected, and Srikanta will provide the required image. Once we receive the image, we will proceed with testing and verification to obtain the certified image through CIA. 

In the meantime, I kindly request your support in helping us obtain the `prometheus-nginxlog-exporter` image as soon as possible. If you could also provide an ETA for the image, it would be greatly appreciated and very helpful.

Let me know if this works!
