Hi [Recipient],

I had a discussion with the SRE team and came up with a few questions. I need your help to confirm or clarify these points. Please let me know if I’m missing something or if anything needs to be added.

1. **Node Exporter Migration**:  
   - We are working on moving from `collectd` to `node-exporter`.  
   - My understanding is that the migration is handled through AMI rotation, and we don’t need to run any playbooks or automation to roll out `node-exporter` on non-BoltX instances.  
   Is this correct? Please let me know if I’m wrong.

2. **Node Exporter Metrics**:  
   - How are node-exporter metrics shared?  
     - Are they sent to a central place where all users can access them?  
     - Or are they mapped 1:1, meaning each tenant can only see their own metrics?  
   Can you clarify how this is set up?

3. **CPU Usage Metrics**:  
   - Can we assume that `mimir-system-metrics` (or some other data source) will give us CPU counts for all roles and all tenants once AMI rotation is done?  
   Is this correct, or do we need to handle it differently?

Please share your thoughts or correct me if I’m wrong. Let me know if there’s anything else I should keep in mind.  

Thanks!
