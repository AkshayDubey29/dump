### Exception Request Details:

1. **Summary**  
   Request for an exception to use the `prometheus-nginxlog-exporter:v1.10.0` image, which is currently running on a non-CIA-based image. This exception is required to avoid risks and delays associated with migrating to a CIA-based Golang image due to unresolved upstream issues.

2. **Component**  
   Prometheus-nginxlog-exporter container.

3. **Organization**  
   Observability Engineering Team, Coupang.

4. **Compensating Control**  
   - Use a CIA-provided Golang base image and internally build the container by copying the binary.  
   - Regularly monitor the upstream repository for updates.  
   - Conduct periodic vulnerability scans on the existing image.

5. **Expiry Date**  
   Specify a reasonable timeframe, e.g., 6-12 months, to review the migration feasibility or until the upstream project receives an update.

6. **Impacted Application**  
   Metrics collection and monitoring using Prometheus via the nginxlog-exporter.

7. **Business Justification**  
   - The upstream project has not been updated in over a year, making migration to a CIA-based image infeasible at this time.  
   - Rebuilding the image internally will introduce risks to core functionalities and require significant development time.  
   - The current image serves as a crucial tool for monitoring NGINX logs and maintaining operational observability.

8. **Expected Security Risks**  
   - The image might have vulnerabilities due to its non-CIA base.  
   - Lack of updates in the upstream project could expose the container to potential exploits.  
   - However, these risks will be mitigated by implementing compensating controls.

9. **Risk Details**  
   - The risk of running a non-CIA-compliant image includes potential security vulnerabilities and compliance issues.  
   - An unseen issue during rebuilding could impact functionality and delay deployment timelines.

10. **Select Exception Category**  
    Security/Compliance Exception.
