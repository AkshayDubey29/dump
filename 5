| **Query Syntax**                    | Legacy aggregation and query syntax                    | New aggregation framework, support for $lookup, $merge, etc.      | Certain aggregation pipelines, queries, and options like `allowDiskUse` have evolved. Queries might break or behave differently.      | Refactor queries to align with the new syntax, especially if using aggregations or sharded queries.                                           | https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/                                                                                                          |

Utilize new index types where beneficial (e.g., wildcard, TTL).           | https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-ttl/                                                                                                                                  |
| **Performance**                     | Moderate performance for legacy workloads              | Significant improvements for modern workloads, including time-series| Existing query optimizations may no longer be relevant. New performance bottlenecks might arise from improper handling of bulk data.   | Profile application performance and adjust queries or indexes based on new performance metrics.                                              | https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/analyzing-mongodb-performance/                                                                                                    |

| **Spring Data MongoDB**             | Version 1.9.2.RELEASE supports MongoDB 2.6.x           | Requires Spring Data MongoDB 3.x+                                | Version 1.9.2 does not support MongoDB 7.x features, so some database operations may fail or behave unpredictably.                     | Upgrade to Spring Data MongoDB 3.x+ to ensure compatibility with the MongoDB 7.x driver and features.                                        | https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-mongodb                                                                                                                                       |
| **Java 8 Compatibility**            | Fully compatible                                       | Still supported, but Java 8 is reaching EOL                       | While Java 8 is supported, some newer MongoDB features might leverage language enhancements in later Java versions (e.g., Java 11+).  | Upgrade to a supported Spring Data version and ensure the MongoDB Java driver is compatible with Java 8.                                      | https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/java/sync/current/                                                                                                                                  |
| **Deprecation of Features**         | Certain features deprecated in 7.x                     | Features like `mapReduce` deprecated                             | Deprecated commands or options (e.g., `mapReduce`) may break the application logic.                                                    | Refactor or replace deprecated features with newer MongoDB capabilities, such as using aggregation framework instead of `mapReduce`.         | https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/map-reduce/                                                                                                                                 |
