We are started working on one project in python named as Guardia, this application is a backend application whose work is to check the health of the services every 2 second minimum and it can be configured upto 15 minutes, now this service will accept the configuration from a config file there we will configure the name of the service, endpoint of the service and duration at which we want to check the health now once that is configured our python backend will start polling listed services and depending upon the duration it will check the health and return the status In json that this endpoint is health and also what's the http code and also latency and also as many as information it can return in jsonnwhich can be helpful for issue debugging or for health checks this json should also have the name of the service which we have configured in config.json this service should be written as plugin to existing system and will have an API endpoint to return the status of all the services at a certain interval so that we can have it on our UI timeline, this service should also return the time at which it has checked the status because we will map it with our UI timeline graph.

For your project, Guardia, you can structure the backend service as follows:

1. Configuration File (config.json)
You can use a JSON file to configure the services to be monitored. An example config.json might look like:

json
Copy code
{
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "Service A",
      "endpoint": "http://service-a.com/health",
      "interval": 5
    },
    {
      "name": "Service B",
      "endpoint": "http://service-b.com/status",
      "interval": 10
    }
  ]
}
2. Backend Structure
You'll need a backend service that reads from the config.json file and then initiates health checks for each service based on the configured intervals. You can use asynchronous programming (via asyncio or threading) to handle this.

3. Health Check Implementation
For checking the service health, you can use the requests library to make HTTP calls to the service endpoints and log the response status, latency, and other details.

4. Returning the Status as JSON
After each check, you will collect the following:

HTTP status code
Latency (response time)
Other details like headers (optional)
Time of the check
Name of the service
Example Python code for the health check and returning the status:

python
Copy code
import json
import time
import requests
from threading import Thread

class HealthCheckService:
    def __init__(self, config_file):
        self.config_file = config_file
        self.services = []
        self.status = {}

    def load_config(self):
        with open(self.config_file, 'r') as f:
            self.services = json.load(f)['services']

    def check_service(self, service):
        while True:
            start_time = time.time()
            try:
                response = requests.get(service['endpoint'])
                latency = time.time() - start_time
                self.status[service['name']] = {
                    "service_name": service['name'],
                    "status": "healthy" if response.status_code == 200 else "unhealthy",
                    "http_code": response.status_code,
                    "latency": latency,
                    "time_checked": time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", time.gmtime())
                }
            except Exception as e:
                self.status[service['name']] = {
                    "service_name": service['name'],
                    "status": "error",
                    "error": str(e),
                    "time_checked": time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", time.gmtime())
                }
            time.sleep(service['interval'])

    def start_health_check(self):
        for service in self.services:
            Thread(target=self.check_service, args=(service,)).start()

    def get_status(self):
        return json.dumps(self.status)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    health_checker = HealthCheckService('config.json')
    health_checker.load_config()
    health_checker.start_health_check()
5. API to Return the Status
You can create a simple API to expose the status using Flask:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import threading

app = Flask(__name__)
health_checker = None

@app.route('/status', methods=['GET'])
def get_status():
    return health_checker.get_status()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    health_checker = HealthCheckService('config.json')
    health_checker.load_config()
    
    # Run health checks in a background thread
    threading.Thread(target=health_checker.start_health_check).start()
    
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
6. Integration with UI
Once you have the /status API up and running, your frontend UI can periodically poll this endpoint to fetch the status of all services and update the timeline graph accordingly.

This setup allows you to configure the monitoring intervals, poll the services, and collect status data in a scalable and efficient manner.

To ensure that Guardia works effectively in a containerized environment with multiple pods on Kubernetes, here are the key considerations and steps you can follow:

1. Containerization (Dockerfile)
You will need a Dockerfile to containerize your Python application. Below is an example Dockerfile for Guardia:

dockerfile
Copy code
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable to ensure Python output is printed
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
In this Dockerfile:

We use the official Python slim image.
The requirements.txt is installed for dependencies like Flask and requests.
The app will be started with CMD ["python", "app.py"].
2. Kubernetes Deployment
To run multiple instances of this service in Kubernetes, you need a Deployment YAML file to define how many replicas (pods) of the service will run and handle their scaling.

Here is a sample kubernetes-deployment.yaml file:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: guardia
spec:
  replicas: 3  # You can scale this based on your requirements
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: guardia
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: guardia
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: guardia-container
        image: your-docker-image-name:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000
        env:
        - name: CONFIG_PATH
          value: "/config/config.json"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: config-volume
          mountPath: /config
      volumes:
      - name: config-volume
        configMap:
          name: guardia-configmap

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: guardia-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: guardia
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 5000
3. ConfigMap for Configuration
Since Guardia will use a config file, a Kubernetes ConfigMap can be used to manage configuration. This allows you to easily update configurations without rebuilding the Docker image.

Example ConfigMap:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: guardia-configmap
data:
  config.json: |
    {
      "services": [
        {
          "name": "Service A",
          "endpoint": "http://service-a.com/health",
          "interval": 5
        },
        {
          "name": "Service B",
          "endpoint": "http://service-b.com/status",
          "interval": 10
        }
      ]
    }
4. Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
To ensure your service scales based on traffic or load, you can use Kubernetes' Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). This will allow your application to scale dynamically depending on CPU or memory usage.

Example HPA:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: guardia-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: guardia
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
5. Service Discovery
If you have multiple instances of the Guardia service, you can use Kubernetes services for internal service discovery. Kubernetes will automatically load balance the traffic between pods running the application.

6. Logging and Monitoring
Ensure that logs are written to stdout and stderr so that Kubernetes can capture them. Use Kubernetes-native solutions like:

Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring.
Fluent Bit/Fluentd for log aggregation.
Kubernetes' liveness and readiness probes to ensure your service remains healthy and ready to serve traffic.
Liveness and readiness probes can look something like this:

yaml
Copy code
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /status
    port: 5000
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /status
    port: 5000
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
7. Handling Scale and High Availability
Since youâ€™ll run this on Kubernetes with multiple pods, the service should handle concurrent checks gracefully. Use locks or limits to ensure no race conditions if multiple instances of the same service are running.

8. Zero Downtime Updates
Implement Kubernetes rolling updates in the deployment strategy to ensure that updates to Guardia do not cause any downtime:

yaml
Copy code
spec:
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1
      maxSurge: 1
This ensures only one pod will be updated at a time while keeping the application available.

9. External API Access
Ensure your deployment has proper access to the internet (through Kubernetes networking or proper role bindings in your cloud provider) so that it can reach external services' health endpoints.

By following these steps and best practices, Guardia should function smoothly in a containerized environment with Kubernetes.
