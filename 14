# **Technical Migration Plan: Coumon to CouWatch**

## **1. Executive Summary**
Coumon is the current alerting and monitoring tool in use, with over 98,420 rules and 3,163 subscribers relying on its alerts for production services. Coumon has reached its limitations in terms of scalability, maintainability, and performance, and it depends on outdated components like MongoDB 2.6.12 and Java 8. This migration plan will shift all alert rules, metrics, and configurations to CouWatch, a Grafana-based platform, to improve scalability, reduce system complexity, and enhance alerting performance.

This document outlines a technical migration plan that will span **two quarters**. It covers:
- The infrastructure setup of CouWatch.
- The migration of metric-based and custom alerts.
- Validation of subscribers and notification channels.
- Risk mitigation strategies.
- The role of the Technical Program Manager (TPM) in driving the migration.
