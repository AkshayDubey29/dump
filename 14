### **Final Conclusion**

The migration from Coumon to CouWatch is essential to modernize our monitoring and alerting infrastructure. CouWatch, being Grafana-based, offers a unified, scalable, and secure platform that addresses the limitations and vulnerabilities of the legacy Coumon system. This migration project, spanning over 20 weeks, is complex due to the high number of existing alerts and services. However, with strong program management oversight, meticulous planning, and collaboration across teams, the migration can be executed smoothly, minimizing disruption to production services.

The focus of this migration is solely on transitioning the alert rules, metrics, custom metrics, and notification integrations from Coumon to CouWatch. No new system installation is required, as the CouWatch platform is already operational. Success will be measured by the full migration of all alerts, ensuring no disruption to existing monitoring processes and validating all custom metrics and notifications.
