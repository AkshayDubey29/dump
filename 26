### **Details of the Updated Architecture**

#### **1. Multi-Cluster Application Deployments**
- Applications are deployed across **multiple Kubernetes clusters (Cluster 1, Cluster 2, ..., Cluster N)**.
- Each cluster runs application pods and the required OE containers (exporters, forwarders, agents).

#### **2. Centralized Operator Deployment**
- The Kubernetes Operator runs in **one or two central clusters** with **High Availability (HA)**:
  - **HA Implementation**:
    - Leader Election ensures only one instance of the Operator is actively managing configurations at any time.
    - Failover mechanisms allow a secondary Operator to take over in case of failure.

#### **3. Workflow**
1. **Application Teams**:
   - Use the **coupang_deployment** repository to define application configurations.
   - Add Labels/Annotations (e.g., `role=prod`, `namespace=observability`) to specify deployment requirements.

2. **Kubernetes Operator**:
   - Watches CRDs in the central clusters.
   - Manages OE container deployments across all clusters (e.g., Cluster 1, Cluster 2, Cluster N).
   - Uses Labels/Annotations to determine where and how OE containers should be deployed.

3. **Multi-Cluster Management**:
   - The Operator in the central clusters uses **Kubernetes API aggregation** to manage deployments across multiple clusters.
   - Deploys OE containers to target clusters based on Labels and Annotations.

4. **Observability**:
   - Deployed OE containers (e.g., exporters, forwarders, agents) in application clusters send logs, metrics, and traces to centralized monitoring systems like **Grafana**, **Prometheus**, or **Splunk**.

---

### **Benefits of the Proposed HA Deployment**
1. **High Availability**:
   - Redundant Operators ensure continued operation in case of a failure.
   - Leader Election avoids conflicts between multiple Operators.

2. **Centralized Control**:
   - Configuration and deployment logic are managed centrally in one or two clusters.
   - Simplifies multi-cluster management.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Supports a large number of application clusters with consistent and automated deployments.

4. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Failover mechanisms and Leader Election ensure reliability.

5. **Observability**:
   - Uniform observability setup across all clusters with minimal manual effort.
