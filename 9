# MoniFlux

MoniFlux is a powerful, flexible, and highly configurable tool designed to perform performance testing and benchmarking for observability infrastructure, including logs, metrics, traces, and events. Built in Go, MoniFlux can simulate a range of load scenarios by generating large amounts of observability data (logs, metrics, etc.) at configurable rates, helping you stress test your systems and gain insights into their performance under load.

This tool supports both individual testing (e.g., just logs or just metrics) and combined testing (logs + metrics + traces). The goal is to help SRE, Observability, and DevOps teams understand how their systems perform under real-world traffic and optimize their observability stack for performance and scalability.

## Key Features

- **Logs, Metrics, Traces & Events**: Test each data type individually or in combination. For example, you can generate logs at 10,000 lines per second while simultaneously generating traces and metrics.
  
- **Custom Log Formats**: Generate different log formats like Catalina logs, Apache logs, Istio logs, custom logs, and more. Configurations can be adjusted on the fly through the UI.

- **Dynamic Load Configuration**: Set the load configuration dynamically from the UI (e.g., generate 10,000 lines of Catalina logs between 2–5 KB per second).

- **Kubernetes Integration**: MoniFlux automatically spawns pods within a Kubernetes cluster to simulate the load. Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts are provided for easy deployment.

- **Benchmarking**: MoniFlux allows users to benchmark their observability infrastructure by capturing how much data (logs, metrics, events, etc.) has been generated, giving valuable insights into system behavior under various loads.

- **Real-Time Load Monitoring**: The tool has a frontend interface that displays the real-time status of the load being generated, offering a live view of your observability system's performance.

- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the tool to generate different log formats, customize payloads, and add new types of observability data.

## How MoniFlux Works

MoniFlux generates observability data by spinning up containers or pods in your Kubernetes cluster and simulating load through configurable generators for logs, metrics, traces, and events. Here's a high-level workflow of how MoniFlux operates:

1. **Configuration**: Users configure the type of load (logs, metrics, traces, or a combination) and specify the parameters such as volume (e.g., 10,000 log lines/second), size (2–5 KB per line), and duration.

2. **Pod Deployment**: MoniFlux uses Kubernetes to automatically deploy pods that generate the configured load. The pods use the backend’s load-generator module to produce data based on the provided configurations.

3. **Monitoring**: The frontend UI provides real-time insights into the data being generated, showing users the current status and performance of their observability infrastructure.

4. **Benchmarking & Analysis**: Once the load test is complete, MoniFlux provides detailed results about the amount of data generated, system latencies, and any performance issues encountered.

## Future Plans

- **Advanced UI Configurations**: In future updates, the UI will be enhanced to allow more complex configurations, including scheduling tests, saving/load configurations, and running comparative benchmarks.
  
- **More Log Types**: Expand support to generate logs for more systems (e.g., Kubernetes logs, cloud provider-specific logs).

- **Data Export & Reporting**: MoniFlux will soon support exporting benchmark results and performance data in common formats like CSV, JSON, or PDF.

- **Plugin System**: A plugin-based system will be developed, allowing contributors to add custom log formats and payloads more easily.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: Backend services are written in Go, so you’ll need Go installed on your system. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- **Node.js**: The frontend is built with React (or another frontend framework), so Node.js is required. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: The project is designed to run in a Kubernetes environment. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)
- **Helm**: MoniFlux uses Helm for Kubernetes deployment. [Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MoniFlux.git
   cd MoniFlux
   ```

2. **Run Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   go run main.go
   ```

3. **Run Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
   ```bash
   cd kubernetes
   kubectl apply -f deployments/moniflux-backend.yaml
   kubectl apply -f deployments/moniflux-frontend.yaml
   ```

5. **Monitor and Control Load**:
   Access the MoniFlux UI at `http://localhost:3000` (if running locally) or the service endpoint in your Kubernetes cluster.
